myOCR
=====

This is an iOS application that was part of my bachelor thesis. It was written in Objective C using the SDK for iOS5. The application uses the open-source library OpenCV to recognize text from a photo (either taken with this application or chosen from the gallery). It was tested and optimized for receipts. The whole project is documented in English.
