myOCR
=====

This is an iOS application that was part of my bachelor thesis. It was written in Objective C using the SDK for iOS5. 
The application uses the open-source library OpenCV to preprocess images and Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text from a photo (either taken with this application or chosen from the gallery).
